# crownstone-lib-nodejs-cloud
Cloud module for the nodejs lib.

# WORK IN PROGRESS
Do not use in current state. The bluenet-nodejs-lib is in the process of being separated into individual modules:
- crownstone-lib-nodejs-core
- crownstone-lib-nodejs-uart
- crownstone-lib-nodejs-ble
- crownstone-lib-nodejs-cloud
- crownstone-lib-nodejs-sse

Will be usable on release 1.0.

This library is made up from 2 parts, one for the Crownstone Cloud and one for the Webhook API. 
You probably don't need the webhook api, but the documentation can be found here [TODO: Write documentation.]
The rest of this document is only regarding the Crownstone Cloud API.

# Installation

If you want to use this library as part of your own codebase, install it using yarn or npm

```
yarn add crownstone-cloud
```
```
npm install crownstone-cloud
```

# Cloning the repository

If you just want to run the library, without getting it from npm, you will have to build manually install the dependencies and build the typescript files to run the examples.
You can do this by running:

```
npm install && npm run build
```

# Getting started


You can use this library as promises or async/await. We will only show async/await here, but all *async* functions are promises. 
This means, everything that can be awaited, can be thenned. More information available on Google.

### Create instance

Let's make an instance of the Crownstone cloud! We will use this instance in the rest of the documentation.
This instance will cache your user tokens.

```
import {CrownstoneCloud} from 'crownstone-cloud';

const cloud = new CrownstoneCloud();
```
If you're using pure node, you can also use require:
```
const csLib = require("crownstone-cloud")
const cloud = new csLib.CrownstoneCloud();
```



### Logging in / authenticating

Before using the cloud library, you should first tell it who you are. You can do this in two ways. You can either log in, using the login method:
```
await cloud.login(crownstoneEmailAddress, crownstonePassword)
```

# API

### CrownstoneCloud

#### *async* login(email: string, password: string) : Promise\<UserLoginData>
>> email: the email address of your Crownstone account.
>>
>> password: the corresponding password.
>>
>> returns UserLoginData: { accessToken: string, ttl: number, userId: string }

#### *async* loginHashed(email: string, hashedPassword: string) : Promise\<UserLoginData> 
>> email: the email address of your Crownstone account.
>>
>> hashedPassword: sha1 hash of the corresponding password.
>>
>> returns UserLoginData: { accessToken: string, ttl: number, userId: string }

> You use this method to login to the Crownstone Cloud. Your userId and accesstoken will be cached in the CrownstoneCloud class instance.


#### hashPassword(plaintextPassword: string) : string
>> plaintextPassword: a password.
>>
>> returns hashedPassword: sha1 hash of the corresponding password.
>
> This will hash the password for you so you can use the loginHashed method with it.

#### *async* hubLogin(hubId: string, hubToken: string) : Promise\<HubLoginData> 
>> hubId: cloudId of the hub
>>
>> hubToken: secret token of the hub

#### setAccessToken(accessToken: string, userId?: string)
>> accessToken: access token from the Crownstone cloud, or an oauth token from a Crownstone user.
>>
>> userId: optionally provide the userId if you know it beforehand.
